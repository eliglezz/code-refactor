# code-refactor
This homework assignment,
We went through the code and removed the excessive use if the <div> tags.
We also changed/updated the css file to male it a bit more concise and a tiny bit more simple.
All this was done while not changing the websites look.
There are still some things that can be fixed but I probably missed it due to lack of experience.
